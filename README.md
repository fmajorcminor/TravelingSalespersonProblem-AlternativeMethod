# CS312TSP

This project took the Traveling Salesperson Problem and put a new spin on it. McKay and I decided to implement two algorithms and combined them into one. We used an algorithm for a convex hull combined with nearest insertion. We found that this gave us a better algorithm than a simple greedy algorithm.
